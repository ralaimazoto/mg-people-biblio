abstract = {Linguistic and archaeological evidence about the origins of the
                  Malagasy, the indigenous peoples of Madagascar, points to
                  mixed African and Indonesian ancestry. By contrast, genetic
                  evidence about the origins of the Malagasy has hitherto
                  remained partial and imprecise. We defined 26 Y-chromosomal
                  lineages by typing 44 Y-chromosomal polymorphisms in 362 males
                  from four different ethnic groups from Madagascar and 10
                  potential ancestral populations in Island Southeast Asia and
                  the Pacific. We also compared mitochondrial sequence diversity
                  in the Malagasy with a manually curated database of 19,371
                  hypervariable segment I sequences, incorporating both
                  published and unpublished data. We could attribute every
                  maternal and paternal lineage found in the Malagasy to a
                  likely geographic origin. Here, we demonstrate approximately
                  equal African and Indonesian contributions to both paternal
                  and maternal Malagasy lineages. The most likely origin of the
                  Asia-derived paternal lineages found in the Malagasy is
                  Borneo. This agrees strikingly with the linguistic evidence
                  that the languages spoken around the Barito River in southern
                  Borneo are the closest extant relatives of Malagasy
                  languages. As a result of their equally balanced admixed
                  ancestry, the Malagasy may represent an ideal population in
                  which to identify loci underlying complex traits of both
                  anthropological and medical interest.}

    abstract = "{The origin of the Malagasy population has been a subject of
                  speculation since the 16th century. Contributions of African,
                  Asian, Indian, Melanesian, Arabic and Persian populations have
                  been suggested based on physical and cultural anthropology,
                  oral tradition, linguistics and later also by archaeology. In
                  the mid-20th century, increased knowledge of heredity rules
                  and technical progress enabled the identification of African
                  and Asian populations as main contributors. Recent access to
                  the genomic landscape of Madagascar demonstrated pronounced
                  regional variability in the relative contributions of these
                  two ancestries, yet with significant presence of both African
                  and Asian components throughout Madagascar. This article
                  reviews the extent to which genetic results have settled
                  historical questions concerning the origin of the Malagasy
                  population. After an overview of the early literature, the
                  genetic results of the 20th and 21th centuries are discussed
                  and then complemented by the latest results in genome-wide
                  analyses. While there is still much uncertainty regarding
                  when, how and the circumstances under which the ancestors of
                  the modern Malagasy population arrived on the island, we
                  propose a scenario based on historical texts and genomic
                  results.}",

                  protoglobalization process that took place over a thousand
                  years ago across the Indian Ocean. Previous efforts to locate
                  the Asian origin of Malagasy highlighted Borneo broadly as a
                  potential source, but so far no firm source populations were
                  identified. Here, we have generated genome-wide data from two
                  Southeast Borneo populations, the Banjar and the Ngaju,
                  together with published data from populations across the
                  Indian Ocean region. We find strong support for an origin of
                  the Asian ancestry of Malagasy among the Banjar. This group
                  emerged from the long-standing presence of a Malay Empire
                  trading post in Southeast Borneo, which favored admixture
                  between the Malay and an autochthonous Borneo group, the
                  Ma’anyan. Reconciling genetic, historical, and linguistic
                  data, we show that the Banjar, in Malay-led voyages, were the
                  most probable Asian source among the analyzed groups in the
                  founding of the Malagasy gene pool.}",
